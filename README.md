## Expense Tracker

We often need to keep check on our expenses as we spend money on things. This expense tracker can be used to store all the expenses. So that anyone can take a look at where they spent their money at once.

You can store the amount spended and on what and it will store the expenses in the database.

- This app is synced with realtime firestore database.
- It will update the current expense to the database as soon as add button is clicked.
- Users can view total expense on top in the navbar.
- It is made using vanilla javascript.

### Run locally.

As it is made using vanilla javascript you don't need to install any framework or run any npm install command.

Just clone the repository and open the index.html file with your preffered browser.

### Things to work on

- Add user authentication.
- Users can categorise expenses as:
  - Day
  - Last week
  - Last Month (or Individual months)
  - Last Year
